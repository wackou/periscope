1
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,591
Where have you been?

2
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,371
Hunting and gathering.

3
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,555
Ah. The victim's name
is Timothy Hartley.

4
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,143
He was killed sometime last night.

5
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:28,020
He was shot in the chest, and then
his throat was slit. Charming.

6
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,996
His I.D. says he's from
about a hundred miles away

7
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,540
from here... Hillsborough.

8
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:32,999
No sign of what he was doing up here.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,304
Sheriff says Hartley's
car's down the road.

10
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:35,761
I'll check it out. All right.

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,995
You tell him? Tell him what?

12
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:41,279
Coroner's office sent Steiner.
Dr. Steiner?

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,041
And we all know how much you
like to make fun of Dr. Steiner,

14
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,314
So don't, okay?

15
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:47,355
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,151
No humoring yourself at his expense.
Is he that way?

17
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,879
Top of the morning to you, Steiner.

18
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,568
You're looking trim.

19
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:58,031
Jane.

20
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,608
Curiously considerate killer.

21
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,530
Slit his throat after the shots
to put him out of his misery.

22
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:09,486
Three steps back, please.

23
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,018
What?

24
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:12,265
Please maintain a distance

25
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,673
Of at least three steps
from the body. Why?

26
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,490
Because this body is a no-Jane zone.

27
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,727
It will not be a playground for you.

28
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:23,903
You will not touch it or sniff
it or place playing cards on it

29
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:25,732
Or borrow it for an interrogation.

30
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:29,623
If you do, a deputy will remove you.
Clear?

31
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,614
That's a little harsh, no?

32
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,182
You have driven me to
desperate measures.

33
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,467
Well, I'm nothing
if I'm not respectful

34
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,216
Of my fellow crime-fighters.

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,549
But I can see everything I
need to from here anyway.

36
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,614
Really? W...

37
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,967
What exactly do you see?

38
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,223
He's in money, but not a banker,

39
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:54,177
Something more aggressive...
stocks or such, social drinker,

40
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:55,893
Increased his intake lately,

41
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,501
So under some pressure.

42
00:01:57,563 --> 00:02:00,870
A registered, uh, independent,
though always votes republican,

43
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,283
And as much money as he
has, his wife has more.

44
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:07,808
Ridiculous. He chose the
tasteless tasseled loafers.

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,346
She bought the opal-enlaced
sterling silver cuff links.

46
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,996
Guesses.

47
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:16,239
You might as well say he's going
to meet a tall, dark stranger.

48
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,356
That's very unlikely, doctor.

49
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,783
He's dead.

50
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,072
And by the way, it looks
like there's something

51
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:24,153
In his left-front pant pocket.

52
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,727
You are about to think,
"What the hell"? "How did Jane..."

53
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,356
"Do that?"

54
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,140
How did you do that?

55
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:48,036
"There are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio,

56
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,926
"Than dreamt of in your philosophy."

57
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:55,795
Okay. You planned ahead.

58
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,724
You asked one of the sheriff's
deputies to call you

59
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,679
The next time Steiner was on a case

60
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,803
And then you asked
them to plant the note.

61
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,579
That is an absurd theory.

62
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,697
You know this means another
apology at the coroner's office.

63
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:07,094
No, it doesn't.

64
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:09,945
Steiner loves the attention. Lisbon.

65
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:12,930
What happened?

66
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,230
Where are they?

67
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,512
Robbery. Two guys in a pickup
pulled the coroner's van over

68
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:23,673
And held it up. What'd they steal?

69
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,956
Huh. Get this... your vic's body.
Hartley's corpse?

70
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,634
That's right.
Steiner tried to stop them,

71
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:29,674
believe it or not.
Dr. Steiner.

72
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:32,016
Agent Lisbon.

73
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,322
It's not as bad as it looks.

74
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:37,326
Go get yourself checked out
and then come talk to us.

75
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:39,121
Jane, was this you?

76
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,449
W... another trick?

77
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:44,244
Oh. Jane had nothing to do
with this, nothing at all.

78
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,609
You didn't, did you?
Of course not.

79
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:51,482
Swear on your life?
On your life, even.

80
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,081
Damn it. Who steals a body?

81
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,476
Interesting.

82
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:02,037

83
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:10,483
The pickup was... pulled over.

84
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,376
There were two men, apparently
working on the engine.

85
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:15,136
They flagged us down,

86
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,615
For help, we thought, and
then they pulled out guns.

87
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,316
Can you describe them?

88
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,688
They were both white,

89
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,436
A little under 6 feet, I think.

90
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,273
I can't really say much more.

91
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:29,417
They wore hooded s...
jackets and sunglasses.

92
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:32,397
One went to the van and
dragged the body bag out.

93
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,608
The one guarding us went
to help him, and...

94
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,409
That's when I...

95
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,291
Intervened.

96
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,372
Foolish.

97
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,055
For once, I agree with you. Mnh.

98
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:46,089
They put the body into the
truck and they... they took off.

99
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,148
Why would anyone do this?
We don't know yet. It's early.

100
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:53,267
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

101
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,327
Thank you for your time, Dr. Steiner.

102
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:56,531
Of course.

103
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,271
Good-bye again, mr. Jane.

104
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:03,876
It wasn't your fault.

105
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,102
Excuse me?

106
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,240
They had guns.

107
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:09,963
Big, scary guns.
There's nothing you could do.

108
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,631
The body is my responsibility,
my reason for being here.

109
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,746
Now I have no reason
or responsibility.

110
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:19,463
There's nothing for me to do.
I don't expect you to understand

111
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:20,896
Why that feels like failure to me,

112
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,817
but it does.
Want a cup of tea?

113
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,615
I don't think so.

114
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,892
Suit yourself.

115
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,038
I like the chapel in Yountville.

116
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:34,097
It's just a long way
for the guests to go.

117
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,376
What did you find out about
Vandermeer State Park?

118
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:38,308
I love that place.

119
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:42,510
I see.

120
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,955
Well, I guess we'll just keep looking.

121
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,715
I love you. Bye.

122
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:49,988
Vandermeer State Park...

123
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,328
Beautiful for a wedding.
I've hiked there.

124
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,075
There's an old quaker meeting house.

125
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:55,999
Oh, it would be perfect,

126
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,812
But I guess they don't allow weddings.

127
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,527
It's too hard on the
ground vegetation.

128
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,237
What do we have on Hartley?

129
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,429
Jane was right.
He was in finance.

130
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,338
Ran a hedge fund called
the H.V. Wilder Fund.

131
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:09,868
But his wife's family has the real money.
Name's Cook. The Cooks?

132
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,083
Yeah, I guess.
Wife's name is Peregrine.

133
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,210
I'll deal with the family.

134
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,486
You go and talk to the
people he worked with.

135
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:17,236
Anything on the missing corpse?

136
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:19,110
Forensics found no
usable prints on the van

137
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:20,890
And nothing from the tire
tracks at the scene.

138
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,121
Why steal a dead body?
What can they use it for?

139
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,433
Got me.

140
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:27,203
Go and have another talk with the
two guys that were with Steiner.

141
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:29,643
Get any details on the
thieves or the truck.

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,247
Van Pelt, look for
any similar crimes,

143
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:34,124
Bodies that were
stolen from hospitals,

144
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,519
ambulances, anything.
Good luck with the Cooks.

145
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:38,241
Yeah, nothing like telling people

146
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:39,268
Their loved ones are dead,

147
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,161
And oh, by the way,
we lost the corpse.

148
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:48,544
None of this makes any sense.

149
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:51,590
The last time I-I spoke to Tim,

150
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,640
He was telling me some stupid
joke he heard at work,

151
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,473
Happy as can be.

152
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,965
Who's responsible, agent?

153
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,633
My son-in-law didn't just disappear.

154
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,512
Someone is accountable.
Who?

155
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:05,018
Ma'am, we don't know yet.
We're doing the best we can.

156
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,132
Not good enough.
Mother!

157
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,551
My dear, when they tell you
they're doing their very best,

158
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,081
That's exactly what they aren't doing.

159
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,992
Hell of a place you've got here.

160
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,497
Where'd you get the money for it?
Excuse me?

161
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,966
The moolah. The scratch.
The shekels. The dollarinis.

162
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,616
What does that have
to do with anything?

163
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,346
Obviously something
you're embarrassed about.

164
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:27,111
Sugar beets. Sugar beets?

165
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,891
My, uh, my grandfather grew them.

166
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,440
I love sugar beets.

167
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,916
There's no shame in
sugar beets, Elspeth.

168
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:35,854
Mrs. Hartley, we found
your husband's body

169
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,922
A hundred miles from here.

170
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,068
Any idea what he was doing out there?
Uh, no, none at all.

171
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,874
Was there anything out of the ordinary

172
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,434
going on in his life?
Troubles at work?

173
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:49,318
Changes in his schedule?
No. We started...

174
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,533
Talking about having...

175
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,762
A family...

176
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,736
A while back.

177
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,379
There, there, dear.

178
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,464
If there are no more questions...

179
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,559
You didn't like your
son-in-law, did you?

180
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:08,822
You found him vulgar despite
his highfalutin job.

181
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,241
And you... you're frightened.

182
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,989
The body's disappearance alarms
you in a very specific way.

183
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,229
What is that?

184
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:21,013
Harrison, please show
our visitors out.

185
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,206
Thank you. I'm good.

186
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,993
Oh, God.

187
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:32,986
Why do these things happen?

188
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,173
How long have you and Mr.
Hartley been partners?

189
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,976
Oh, uh, five years or so.

190
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,046
We were both interested in a fund

191
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,895
That offered slightly esoteric
financial instruments.

192
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,377
A hedge fund.
What we do is pretty complicated.

193
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,841
I don't want to bore
you with the details.

194
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:49,418
As I understand it,
you rely on a strategy

195
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,944
That exploits mean
reversion tendencies

196
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:54,389
Of crosscurrent far forward rates.
Is that right? Yes.

197
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:57,061
What did Mr. Hartley
do for the fund?

198
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,307
Built it.
Designed the strategy.

199
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,730
Certifiable genius.
The best.

200
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:03,957
A fund like yours can lose
people a lot of money.

201
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,145
Any angry investors? No, no, no.

202
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,513
Recently, we've had excellent returns.

203
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:12,851
What about work?
Did hartley have problems here?

204
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,685
"Loved" Is the word.

205
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:17,655
How about trouble at home?
No. Tim adored Peregrine.

206
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,560
He... he... he was a boy scout.

207
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,643
He would never play around,
wouldn't even think of it.

208
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,159
He's a straight... straight arrow.

209
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,216
I see.

210
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,687
The straightest.

211
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,711
So nothing new from
the guys with Steiner,

212
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,963
But it wasn't an entirely
wasted journey. I got scones.

213
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:36,640
I found something.

214
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,350
Three other corpses have been stolen

215
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,662
From vehicles leaving crime scenes

216
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,107
over the past six months.
Huh. Who caught the cases?

217
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:46,022
We did. Rigsby. O'Laughlin.
Why is the FBI on this?

218
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:48,147
It's interstate. One of the
corpses was taken in Nevada.

219
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:49,499
You guys have a theory? Yeah.

220
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,259
We think the bodies are
being sold at tissue banks.

221
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,139
Tissue banks? They harvest bone
and tissue from the corpses,

222
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,755
Then sell them to
medical supply houses.

223
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:57,604
You're supposed to get
permission from the family

224
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,663
To sell the corpse, but these
guys are skipping that part.

225
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,792
And tissue banks are regulated,

226
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,893
So more likely the thieves are
working with the Funeral Home.

227
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,514
They provide the
bodies to tissue banks.

228
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,297
I put together a list of
Funeral Homes in the area.

229
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,331
We can start with that. Great, yeah.

230
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:12,186
Hey, Rigsby, my boss
asked me to come,

231
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,349
You know, since I've worked
with CBI before. Hmm.

232
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,983
I'm not trying to get in
your face is all I'm saying.

233
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,198
Didn't think you were.

234
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,144
Okay, good. Okay.

235
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,250
Dr. Steiner, I presume.

236
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,848
What brings you back?

237
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:34,595
Good news, actually.

238
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,438
A small amount of blood was recovered

239
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,225
From the dirt under the
body at the crime scene.

240
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:42,402
It contains two distinct
DNA signatures.

241
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:43,981
The killer got cut, too.

242
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,480
Yes, probably while using
a knife on the victim.

243
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,102
There's not enough blood for an I.D.,

244
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:51,599
But there could be more on the corpse.

245
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,547
Interesting. Why did you come
and tell me that in person

246
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,406
Instead of calling?

247
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,456
I would like to assist in some
small way, if that's all right.

248
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,546
Okay. Let's go get
you a gun, shall we?

249
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,565
Kidding. Welcome. Come on.

250
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,922
Look sharp, Lisbon.
We have a visitor.

251
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,707
Dr. Steiner? Can I help you?

252
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,932
Well, actually, I...

253
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,031
Steiner's gonna be
joining us for a while.

254
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,382
Um... okay.

255
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:29,403
What is all this mess? It's Hartley's
calendar and phone records.

256
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,655
We're making a list of people
he saw before he died.

257
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,796
Meh. Clerical work.

258
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,384
We need to figure out what
the big secret is. What big secret?

259
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,770
Yeah, what big secret?

260
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:41,706
The big, weird secret that
the widow and the partner

261
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:43,353
And everyone won't tell us about

262
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,066
Because it's too shameful to mention.

263
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,602
It's funny you should mention that.

264
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,708
He... he did have an appointment
every week with no description.

265
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:53,028
Thursdays, 2:15 to 3:30.
No name, no address. Interesting.

266
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,835
Clerical work, huh? Touch?

267
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,654
If I may, his car's GPS
might have an address.

268
00:11:58,713 --> 00:11:59,717
Yes, it might.

269
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,576
See? Useful already.

270
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,218
2729 Hillview Avenue.

271
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,499
This is the address
in Hartley's GPS.

272
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,076
Okay, what's the game with Steiner?

273
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,306
No game. What's he doing here, then?

274
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,389
What are any of us doing here?

275
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,505
We don't bring guests
on investigations.

276
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,808
Maybe we should. A different
mystery sleuth for each case.

277
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,914
Well, if this is some
gag you're pulling...

278
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,355
It's not. He asked
if he could come along,

279
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,135
And I said he could.
All right? That's it.

280
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,617
We're building bridges,
mending fences... okay.

281
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,482
Planting seeds... uh-huh.

282
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,495
Laying foundations. Okay.

283
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:36,193
It's a medical building, G.P.'s,
dentists, but mostly shrinks

284
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,634
How do you know who to talk to?

285
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,985
Any calls from his phone
records to this address?

286
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,930
No, but we can check his
bank records for payments.

287
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,272
Oh, we'd need a warrant for that.

288
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,054
I'd rather just
start knocking on doors.

289
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,030
Then we're gonna
need more people.

290
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,510
You'll have to clear that with admin.

291
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,871
Okay, everybody, outside! Outside!

292
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,356
Come on! It's not a drill! Whoo!

293
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,521
Oh, God, Jane.
Why do you do things like this?

294
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,138
Hustle it out. Hustle it out.
That's the way. Okay, come on.

295
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,158
All of you.

296
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:06,861
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

297
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:09,331
My name is Patrick Jane.
I'm with the CBI.

298
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,516
We are looking for the doctor
who treated Timothy Hartley.

299
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:15,518
I know you have a doctor/patient
confidentiality thing.

300
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:18,102
Let's not worry about that right now.

301
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,676
Would Timothy Hartley's doctor
please raise his or her hand?

302
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,233
Raise it on up.

303
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,907
I know it's one of you.
Maybe to your right,

304
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,706
Maybe to your left. Up, up, up,
up with your hand. Bring it up.

305
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,870
Okay, so no one has raised their hand.

306
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:38,058
That doesn't matter because
I know that you, ma'am,

307
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,888
Are the person who we seek.
Please come forward.

308
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,602
Everyone else, thank you,
and back to your quackery.

309
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,460
What's your name, ma'am?

310
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,959
Dr. Wendelyne McCormick.

311
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:52,072
And I won't discuss my patients

312
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:54,156
Of the fact that
someone is my patient.

313
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,618
We're investigating the
murder of Timothy Hartley.

314
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,451
He was killed last night.

315
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,681
Oh, god.

316
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:03,892
All right.

317
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:06,450
How did you know it was me?

318
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,883
Everyone else was looking
around to see who it was,

319
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,269
But you weren't, because you knew.

320
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:16,283
Great. The fire department.
I'll go talk to 'em.

321
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,891
Tim had been in therapy
for about four months.

322
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,656
He'd had a traumatizing experience

323
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:24,235
That he wanted to work through.
What kind of an experience?

324
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,658
Agent, can I get some assurance
of discretion from you?

325
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:31,525
It's a sensitive matter
to the people around him.

326
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,040
We can't promise anything.

327
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,913
Very well.

328
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,392
About five months ago,

329
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:40,740
He had an abduction experience.
Excuse me?

330
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:44,267
He believed he was abducted
by extraterrestrial beings...

331
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,237
Taken to their ship, examined,

332
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,238
And released.

333
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,543
Kidnapped by aliens.

334
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:58,584
Cool.

335
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,887
I was being lifted by
the light, up and away.

336
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:07,274
I-I couldn't... couldn't do anything.

337
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,401
I was just being...
taken right to the ship.

338
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:11,751
It happened when
Hartley was driving home

339
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,026
From a trip to Reno.

340
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:15,422
We found a couple of these
videos on his personal laptop,

341
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:17,484
Some kind of diary of the event.

342
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,383
And once on the ship, there were...

343
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,902
There were beings all around me,

344
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,954
Small...

345
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,598
Small...

346
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,681
Just ash gray.

347
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,428
And there were a
little taller ones too...

348
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,937
They're the same color.

349
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,847
They were leaders, I think.

350
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,014
It just all feels so...

351
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:40,489
It feels so concrete,

352
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,468
So real.

353
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:46,212
Crazy. He sounds sincere to me.

354
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:49,129
Sincerely cuckoo.
I don't see any sign he's lying.

355
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,996
It could be a dream
that he experienced

356
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,620
During a hypnagogic state.
That would make it true for him,

357
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,878
But not objectively real. Exactly.
I agree with him completely.

358
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,558
Thousands of people say
it's happened to them.

359
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,986
They can't all be crazy or lying. Hmm.

360
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,850
I'm just saying you
should keep an open mind.

361
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,566
You can't prove there aren't aliens.

362
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,972
That's true. Okay, the point is,

363
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,980
the wife had to have known about this.

364
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,526
We need to talk to her again. Yeah.

365
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,152
Where are we with the body hunt?

366
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:15,122
We've identified eight funeral parlors

367
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:17,721
That had extensive legitimate
dealings with tissue banks.

368
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,446
We're gonna start with them.
We're splitting the interviews

369
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:21,502
with O'Laughlin.
All right, let me know what you find.

370
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,918
Okay. Watch the skies, Grace.

371
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:30,746
Tim told me as soon as it happened.

372
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,877
He said he met them in a
field outside Auburn.

373
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,849
Where we found his body? Mm-hmm.

374
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,254
He kept going back.
He couldn't tell me why.

375
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:42,971
I mean, he knew it wasn't rational.

376
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,914
Why didn't you tell us this before?

377
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:47,830
I got a call from Art Vella,

378
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:50,128
Tim's partner.

379
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,065
He told me not to
mention it, begged me.

380
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,942
He said it would be
devastating for the business.

381
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,871
You believed your husband's
story, didn't you?

382
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,870
That's why you were so scared
when the body disappeared.

383
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:03,610
Okay, okay.

384
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,988
Listen to me.

385
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:09,567
My husband wasn't crazy.

386
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,387
Okay?

387
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,946
He wouldn't lie to me about
something like that.

388
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:17,494
Rubbish! When someone tells you
something contrary to fact,

389
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,357
They are lying, full stop.

390
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,549
Don't start, mother.

391
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:25,968
Agents, my son-in-law was
drunk or drug-addled or both.

392
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:29,122
As for this tabloid trash
about men from Mars...

393
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:29,959
Ladies. How can you say that?

394
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,842
Ridiculous. Just ridiculous!
This is so like you, mother...

395
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,568
I've never heard
such twaddle in my life...

396
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,770
so closed off and close-minded.
And he said it with a straight face.

397
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,114
You honestly think...

398
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,269
Ladies. Ladies, that's enough.

399
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,571
Wait. What are you looking for?

400
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,466
Ah, yes.

401
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,143
You're a scotch man, right?

402
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:53,388
Uh, yes. I...

403
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,256
Oh, no, no. I-I shouldn't.

404
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:06,261
You really should.

405
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:09,982
Cheers.

406
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,300
You know, don't you?

407
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,921
Excuse me?

408
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,606
You know that I'm sick.

409
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:25,113
Why would Patrick Jane, of all people,

410
00:18:25,323 --> 00:18:27,449
Invite me to a fancy house

411
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,971
And put a first-rate scotch
in my hand if he didn't know?

412
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,531
You've lost some weight... 8 pounds.

413
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,888
Yes.

414
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:37,853
Your face is looking drawn.

415
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,548
You're taking some
powerful medication.

416
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,626
I can see it in the
pallor of your skin.

417
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,085
Yes.

418
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,737
I'm dying.

419
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,217
I have a month...

420
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:51,566
Most likely, maybe less.

421
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:56,169
I'm sorry.

422
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,739
Thank you for the distraction.

423
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,545
Well, it's always good to...

424
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,381
Keep busy.

425
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:16,147
There's probably some, uh,
Havana cigars in that box there.

426
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,340
No. No, no. I...

427
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:19,989
I couldn't.

428
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,256
Could I?

429
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:26,628
Well, you're right.

430
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,834
This is a good cigar.

431
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,603
The only other time

432
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,773
That I had been in a room like this

433
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,504
Was to examine a man
who died accidentally

434
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:49,446
In the middle of an autoerotic ritual.

435
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:52,078
Well, I bet he died with
a smile on his face.

436
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,130
Excuse me.

437
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,280
Can I help you? Ahem.

438
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:13,317
Why did you tell Peregrine
Hartley to lie to us, sir?

439
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:16,496
I didn't tell her to lie.

440
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:20,213
I asked Peregrine not to raise
certain relevant information.

441
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,246
Why'd you do that?

442
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:28,215
Tim was the brain.
I handled clients, administration.

443
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:31,829
Tim was the brain.
It's all about confidence.

444
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,427
If the investors hear about
alien probes and whatnot,

445
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,259
Confidence goes right out the window.

446
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,446
Then I assume you asked him not
to talk about this. Constantly.

447
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:40,648
But Mr. Hartley
was growing certain

448
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,231
His experiences were real.

449
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,222
He must've wanted to talk about it.

450
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:47,628
We had some arguments about it.
Bad arguments?

451
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,418
I didn't kill tim because he wanted

452
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,893
To go public with his cuckoo story.

453
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:55,397
You need to talk to that UFO
fruitcake that Tim met.

454
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,258
They're friends about a week,

455
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,023
And then tim wanted nothing
more to do with him.

456
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:58,800
I think he was trying to

457
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,067
squeeze some money out of Tim.
What's his name?

458
00:21:01,437 --> 00:21:04,683
Kirk. Can you believe that?

459
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,390
Newsom Kirk.

460
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,910
Is there any way
you can keep this quiet?

461
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:14,576
I doubt it.
$2.8 billion in assets.

462
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:18,114
We're going down because
my partner thought he was

463
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:20,158
kidnapped by little green men.

464
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,649
Gray.

465
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,522
What?

466
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:25,615
The little men. They're gray.

467
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:27,848
Thanks for your time. Appreciate it.

468
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,204
Two down, two to go.
Wanna grab some food?

469
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,394
Oh, there's an errand I wanna run.

470
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:33,524
Give me half an hour. I'll catch up.

471
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,571
Where you going? I'll take you.

472
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,870
You don't need to do that.
Oh, come on. How far is it?

473
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:38,876
It's a little ways. It's okay.

474
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:41,898
It's a wedding thing. Oh, I see.

475
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,987
Why don't I drop you off?
I'll grab something to eat,

476
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,066
And then stay in the car, okay?

477
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,389
Sure.

478
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:10,214
Hello.

479
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:12,880
O'Laughlin. I tried Grace.
She didn't answer.

480
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,620
She's busy.
I've got something.

481
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:18,042
Gary Wineman, funeral director.

482
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,822
Mentioned tissue banks,
and he got very nervous.

483
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:23,982
Mr. Wineman, these are
my colleagues from CBI,

484
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,714
Agents Rigsby and Van Pelt.

485
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:28,363
Did agent O'Laughlin mention
what this was about, sir?

486
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:32,103
Uh, some... bodies have been stolen

487
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,700
That might have gone to a tissue bank?

488
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,338
No, that's the FBI's investigation.

489
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,990
We're investigating a murder.

490
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,036
Oh.
You didn't say anything about that.

491
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:46,680
I certainly don't know anything about it.
Well, I hope so, sir.

492
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,114
A case like this,
anyone connected to it...

493
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:50,403
Even remotely connected...
is in big trouble.

494
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,071
Best thing to protect yourself...

495
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,667
Be very clear about what you
know and what you've done.

496
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,496
Oh, god. Uh, look...

497
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,662
W-we...

498
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:04,601
My wife had a baby girl,

499
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,599
And we needed a little extra cash,

500
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:11,149
So I started selling
bodies to tissue banks...

501
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,590
A-all... all legitimate.

502
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,252
I got permission every time.

503
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:18,249
But the banks always want more bodies,

504
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,182
And my wife got pregnant again.

505
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:21,786
Look, who came to you?

506
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:25,033
My cousin. Not a good person.

507
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,177
He said that if we split the fee,

508
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:31,192
He could provide bodies,
no permission necessary.

509
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,910
All I have to do was
dummy up paperwork,

510
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,482
Giving them false names.
Did he bring you a corpse today?

511
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:38,271
No, no, no, no.
But I... he has done this before

512
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:41,722
With other funeral homes.
His name is Owen Melling.

513
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,830
I-I-I had no I...
where is he now, sir?

514
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:47,310
Melling's done time for
assault, armed robbery,

515
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,616
And truck hijacking.

516
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,992
Did the truck jobs with a
buddy named Jim Matthews.

517
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:54,198
Both are on parole.
Melling owes 15 years, Matthews... 12.

518
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,122
And they know if they get picked up,

519
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,562
They're violated back in.
It's good times.

520
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,475
Owen Melling?
CBI.

521
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,149
We need to talk to you about
a robbery this morning.

522
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,144
Just wanna get some facts straight.

523
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,934
Come down to the office,
and we can explain.

524
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,353
Jim. Cops.

525
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:17,227
Jim Matthews?
Yeah. What's up?

526
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:19,645
Says it's about some
robbery this morning.

527
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,504
So what?

528
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:24,382
We were right here. That's right.
Been here all day.

529
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,958
Yeah, well, we still
need to talk to you.

530
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,252
Now get your hands
out of your pocket.

531
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,279
Hands where we can see 'em.
You heard him. Now.

532
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,210
Don't hassle my boy!
He ain't done nothin'!

533
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,554
Put the weapon down, ma'am.

534
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,645
You just wanna make more
trouble for him. I won't have it.

535
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:40,667
We just wanna talk to your son.
Everything's gonna be fine.

536
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,414
Just put down the gun, ma'am.

537
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:49,839
Gun!

538
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:18,668
O'Llaughlin, Grace is in trouble.
Cover me.

539
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:23,811
O'Laughlin!

540
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,518
Grace, get down!

541
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,244
On the ground! Face down! Now!

542
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:38,235
Get on the ground!

543
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,556
How'd the interview
with Matthews go?

544
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,120
Didn't.
He asked for a lawyer.

545
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,455
What'd you find in Melling's house?
No sign of Hartley's body.

546
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,181
Forensics is checking
the pickup for DNA.

547
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:56,699
I got something.
According to his cell phone records,

548
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:59,502
Melling made a call yesterday
to a Wellview Funeral Home.

549
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,955
Could be where they
dropped off Hartley's body.

550
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:03,611
Get Steiner and go and check it out.
If the body's there,

551
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:04,566
He's the one to I.D. It.
Sure.

552
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,288
Tracked down an address
for Newsom Kirk,

553
00:26:06,324 --> 00:26:07,928
the guy Hartley had
a falling-out with.

554
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:09,427
He runs an organization for abductees

555
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:10,916
Called the Fourth Kind Foundation.

556
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:12,845
Office is downtown.
Does he have a sheet?

557
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:14,336
Running it now.

558
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:16,783
We'll go talk to him.
Call if anything pops. Okay.

559
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:24,169
Newsom Kirk, I'm agent Lisbon.

560
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:25,953
This is agent Cho.
We're with the CBI.

561
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:28,085
Yes, yes. You called. Welcome.

562
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:29,606
Welcome.

563
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,225
Agent Cho, you... you've...
you've been, haven't you?

564
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,464
Excuse me?

565
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:37,453
Up. Taken, with them.

566
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,019
No.

567
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,812
Well, I'm getting a... I'm
getting a definite sense.

568
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,208
It sometimes takes a person years

569
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,379
To realize they've had the experience.

570
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:50,461
Timothy Hartley.
Of course. Sorry.

571
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:52,917
You met him through
the foundation, right?

572
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:55,104
Yeah. We're here to serve abductees,

573
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:59,339
Um, help them come to terms
with their experience.

574
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,832
Oh. Spread the word.

575
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:03,307
Uh, Tim wanted to talk about
what he'd been going through.

576
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:05,816
He asked us to keep it in
confidence, and... and we did.

577
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,628
And that's all you did...
talk about his experience?

578
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,742
No. As a matter of fact,
Tim had a lot of money.

579
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:15,729
And frankly, we... we need money,

580
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,507
We had... we had several
quite serious discussions

581
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,800
About funding this... this place.

582
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:22,353
As a child...

583
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,447
Did... did you have, um, dreams

584
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:27,384
Where you were floating
through the house

585
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:29,676
As though pulled by an unseen force?

586
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:30,944
No.

587
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,107
Uh, we heard that the, uh, two of you

588
00:27:35,157 --> 00:27:37,049
Had some sort of a falling-out?

589
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,354
He decided that he wanted to
start his own foundation.

590
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:42,191
Uh, his right, I say.
It never got angry?

591
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:44,978
No, no. Uh, if you're looking

592
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:46,709
For someone Tim
had a fight with,

593
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:48,719
You should talk to that shrink of his.

594
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,620
Uh, McCormick.

595
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,730
She wanted to write a book about him.

596
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:56,396
He said no. She was angry.

597
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:58,574
Okay. Boss, from Rigsby.

598
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:02,871
Uh, Mr. Newsom, is your
real name Garrett Rosten?

599
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,838
And did you spend a year
in Chino prison for fraud?

600
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:08,167
Because your arrest
record says you did.

601
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:13,051
In my previous life, I
was Garrett Rosten, yes.

602
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,354
Mr. Hartley seems like the kind of guy

603
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,585
Who would research somebody

604
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:18,247
If he was considering funding them.

605
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:22,442
Did he find out about this?
I never hid Garrett.

606
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:26,062
I'm simply a different person now.
Not that different.

607
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:29,493
There's a bench warrant out for
your arrest for kiting checks.

608
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,913
We're gonna have to take you in.
Turn around, please.

609
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,318
It's... it's okay. It's...

610
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,846
Just a misunderstanding.

611
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,697
Hey, agent.

612
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:42,773
The important thing is that you
take a look inside yourself

613
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:45,461
And start questioning
those experiences...

614
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:47,442
That you can't explain.

615
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,603
Never happened.

616
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:50,559
I believe you.

617
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,481
Wake up.

618
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,867
Newsom Kirk posted bail.
He's gonna be gone in an hour.

619
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,655
Just in time for the
6:10 to Alpha Centauri.

620
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:06,148
He was right about
Hartley's psychiatrist.

621
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,541
She did propose a book,
but she withdrew it.

622
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:10,518
So she had motive. Kinda.

623
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:13,088
Who do you think did it?
Jabba the Hutt.

624
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,245
Seriously. Ming the merciless.

625
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:16,826
Okay. Alf?

626
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,230
When the aliens do come,
I hope they eat you. Mm.

627
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,192
Lisbon.

628
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,508
Theresa, Brenda Shettrick.

629
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:29,901
A local news crew is about
to interview Dr. Steiner

630
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:32,375
About the Hartley case.
Just thought you'd like to know.

631
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:35,195
He's supposed to be looking
for Hartley's body.

632
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,156
No, he's here.

633
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,348
What interview?

634
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,694
Some background on tissue
banks and the corpse trade.

635
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,916
There's a lot of interest.
He offered to do it.

636
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:44,243
You didn't know anything?

637
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,494
I'll be right there.

638
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:49,556
Bye, Lisbon. Oh.

639
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:56,268
The legitimate trade in
tissue is a valuable source

640
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:58,319
Of biological material
for medical use.

641
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:00,362
Unfortunately, this illegal trade

642
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,902
Has halted the investigation

643
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:04,173
Into the death of Timothy Hartley.
How's that?

644
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,741
Well, I-I just came
from a funeral home

645
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,981
Where we had hoped to find mr.
Hartley's body,

646
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:10,795
And it's... it's... it's not there.

647
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:12,302
The thieves have hidden it somewhere.

648
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,818
And there is crucial
evidence... blood evidence...

649
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:18,013
On Mr. Hartley's body that
will identify the killers.

650
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:20,548
Brenda.
If we don't find that evidence...

651
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,014
Now. Guys, that's it.
Thanks very much.

652
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,738
Did I do something wrong?

653
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,068
We don't talk to the
press about evidence.

654
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,108
It kinda tells the killer
what we're looking for.

655
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,123
Oh. Sorry.

656
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:33,998
How did I do otherwise?
Oh, good.

657
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,172
Hey, Cho.

658
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:38,927
Yeah.

659
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:41,759
I think O'Laughlin flaked
on Van Pelt yesterday.

660
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,207
What do you mean?

661
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,816
Well, he saw she was in trouble
and he didn't do anything.

662
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,060
Guess he was scared. It happens.

663
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:51,919
Yeah. Van Pelt doesn't know this?

664
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:53,072
No.

665
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:54,516
I don't know.

666
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,095
The question is,
does she need to know?

667
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,543
Yeah, it's tough.
Your call.

668
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,286
You saw the news story
on Hartley's body?

669
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,403
Well, I lied. I did find the body.

670
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,586
There is evidence on it,

671
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:19,243
And it will convict you of murder.

672
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,533
But I haven't given
the police the body.

673
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:25,641
I've kept it, and
I'm willing to sell it,

674
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:28,525
Along with my silence, for $50,000.

675
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,259
Because I'm a dying man.

676
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:34,641
All I want is a few days of
real comfort before I'm gone.

677
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:39,322
Think about it.
You know how to reach me.

678
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,599
How was that?

679
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,024
Not bad.

680
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,718
Little over-the-top,

681
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,259
But, you know, credible, nonetheless.

682
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:51,590
Sorry.

683
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,861
Still getting used
to all this deception.

684
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,864
What deception?

685
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,860
You did find Hartley's
body at a funeral home.

686
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,952
Yes, but there was no
blood evidence on it.

687
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:04,269
You can't catch a fish without bait.

688
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:07,062
We will tell agent Lisbon
what's going on, yes?

689
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:10,307
Oh, yeah, eventually.
Agent Lisbon's a good person.

690
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:12,040
She reminds me of...

691
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:14,659
Never mind.

692
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:18,302
Showtime. Huh?
Let's go.

693
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:19,921
Whoo! Whoo!

694
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:21,471
Yes?

695
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,611
Testing one, two.

696
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:30,777
Testing two.

697
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:36,512
Yes, Dr. Steiner, We can
hear you, just like before.

698
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,861
I'm a little nervous.

699
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:39,845
You're doing a great job.
You look the part.

700
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:41,696
Are you sure about this?

701
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:45,018
Are you ever gonna tire
of asking me that? No.

702
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,525
Someone's coming.

703
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:09,673
Go.

704
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,502
Dr. Steiner?
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

705
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,335
Hands! Hands in the air!
I'm not armed.

706
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,722
I'm... I'm not armed.
I'm not armed.

707
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:18,971
It's the butler! It's the butler!
It's the butler!

708
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:21,531
It's the but... the butler did it!
I always wanted to say that.

709
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:24,691
But wait. It gets better.

710
00:33:25,996 --> 00:33:26,731
Ms. Cook.

711
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:30,585
Good evening. Remember me?
I can't hear anything with this.

712
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,647
The good doctor here told us
that Timothy Hartley's murder

713
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,791
cut himself whilst doing the killing.

714
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:38,446
Yeah. Would you mind terribly
showing me your hand?

715
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,727
Oh.

716
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,311
You must let Harrison go.

717
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,219
He has done nothing but serve
me faithfully and well.

718
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:53,736
As I explained, ma'am,

719
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:56,500
Our D.A. Will drop the
charges against your Butler,

720
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:58,878
If you answer our questions honestly.

721
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,615
I feel like I'm haggling in a
bazaar over the cost of a rug.

722
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:08,148
But if you will release
Harrison, then I will speak.

723
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:09,879
Your son-in-law was about to go public

724
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:13,471
With the whole alien adventure
thing, wasn't he? More than that.

725
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:16,847
He wanted to start a global
foundation for abductees,

726
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:19,722
To see to their needs and
promote their cause.

727
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,507
He was gonna call it The
Cook Family Foundation.

728
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:25,736
Well, that wasn't going to happen.

729
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:29,064
No, you cannot do this.

730
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,026
I won't allow it.
It's not something you can stop.

731
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:35,135
Try me. I am not without
resources, young man.

732
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,256
But he said he was going to
use his own money for it.

733
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:41,128
And then he said...
time's on my side, Elspeth.

734
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,978
What do you mean, Timothy?!

735
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:46,998
Timothy, come back here!

736
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,568
I knew what he meant.
Hartley was going to wait

737
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:52,007
Until I was dead,
and then use my money

738
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:53,747
And my daughter to
turn the Cook name

739
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,512
Into an international joke.

740
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:59,097
So the next time he went to that
place he was always visiting,

741
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,414
We followed.

742
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:10,873
Why slit Hartley's throat?

743
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:12,968
That was the telltale sign...

744
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,195
A hunter's humanity, if you will.

745
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:19,296
You learned how to hunt
and kill at a young age,

746
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,267
Didn't you, Elspeth?

747
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:23,170
Your father taught you.

748
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:26,716
Yes. He was very firm on that point.

749
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:29,216
"Never let the animal suffer."

750
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,876
I got awfully cross with
Consuela for mislaying this.

751
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,333
I shall have to apologize.

752
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:38,866
Mm.

753
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:51,428
Hey. What's up?

754
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,713
There's something I have to
talk to you about. What's that?

755
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,029
Wayne?

756
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:58,597
What is it?

757
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:07,428
A friend of mine is a ranger
at Vandermeer State Park,

758
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:10,461
And maybe I can get him to give
you a waiver to get married

759
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,230
At that quaker meeting house.
Really?

760
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:15,149
Yeah. I think. I can try.

761
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:18,187
Wayne, that's fantastic. Mwah.

762
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:19,826
Thank you so much. Yeah.

763
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:22,952
I'm gonna call Craig.
Yeah, okay.

764
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:34,405
Please.

765
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:36,658
Thank you for coming by.

766
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:37,874
Oh, it's no problem.

767
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:41,270
Nice place. Tidy.

768
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,491
Thank you.

769
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,763
Please.

770
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:47,240
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciated

771
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:50,836
Your letting me come along
on your investigation.

772
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,566
It was fun.

773
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:54,610
Hmm, it was fun, wasn't it?

774
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:56,172
That was my pleasure.

775
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:57,993
Thank you.

776
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,951
Um, look... ahh.

777
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,721
Won't beat around the bush.

778
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:05,448
About me dying,

779
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:09,040
I-I know what's going to happen now.

780
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:10,638
I've seen it.

781
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,920
There are no mysteries.

782
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,357
It's going to get bad...

783
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,236
Very soon,

784
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,322
And then worse.

785
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:20,656
And I have no interest

786
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,750
In letting nature take its course.

787
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,522
You understand?

788
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:26,472
Uh, yes.

789
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,981
You, uh, you want to kill yourself.

790
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:30,432
In a nutshell.

791
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,731
I have pills I can take.

792
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:36,682
The problem is,

793
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:40,848
If there is an unexplained death,

794
00:37:40,898 --> 00:37:44,074
If a body is found in an apartment,

795
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:47,472
There is an investigation, an autopsy.

796
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:48,206
Mm.

797
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,227
And the idea of being examined,

798
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:52,999
Of being a body on the...

799
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:54,315
On the table...

800
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:02,530
But if the death is witnessed
by a law enforcement officer,

801
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,771
No investigation is required.

802
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,193
I'm not a law enforcement officer.

803
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,406
You're close enough, I think.

804
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:17,455
I don't know that I can do
it, that I can witness that.

805
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,918
I'm not even sure that killing
yourself is the best idea.

806
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,062
It's what I'm going to do.

807
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:32,709
Well, that's your choice.

808
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,036
But, uh...

809
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:42,755
I understand. I...

810
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:44,895
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:47,409
This was a t...

812
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,091
Terrible imposition.

813
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:50,857
I-I shouldn't have.

814
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,433
Please.
Forget I said anything.

815
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:55,514
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,620
Do you have any tea?

817
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:03,271
Yes, I do.

818
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:05,200
I could really use a cup of tea.

819
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:07,623
Okay.

820
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:10,290
Sure.

821
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:14,060
Uh...

822
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:16,695
There's cookies in the cupboard. Yeah.

823
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:18,925
Uh... uh, would you like a cup?

824
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:20,756
Thank you. Yeah.

825
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:24,912
Well, uh, I'm going in
the other room now.

826
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:27,526
I'll be a few minutes.

827
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,286
Yeah. Take your time.

828
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,480
Here.

829
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:57,227
Mmm.

830
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,214
The note in the
dead man's... pocket...

831
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:13,386
You... you had an arrangement

832
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,537
With the deputy, didn't you?

833
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:19,109
Yes, I did.

834
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:22,800
I knew it.

835
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:24,192
Yeah.

836
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,075
It's an old carny magic trick.

837
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:29,624
You did magic?

838
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:30,614
Oh, yeah.

839
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,856
I first started out,
uh, working close-up

840
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,668
With, uh, cards and coins.

841
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:39,568
Really?

842
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,297
Yeah. I'll show you.

843
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:44,216
Got a coin in here.

844
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,310
Yeah. Okay.

845
00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:48,621
See that coin?

846
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:51,065
It's there, right?

847
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:54,875
And it's gone.

848
00:40:55,435 --> 00:40:56,735
It's there...

849
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:00,317
Then it's gone.

850
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:03,163
Amazing.

851
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:04,700
It's really quite simple.

852
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:06,215
It's there...

853
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:09,649
And then it's gone.

854
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,124
Patrick...

855
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,354
Thank you.

856
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,025
Just watch the coin.

857
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:19,338
And it's gone.

858
00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:23,948
It's there...

859
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:28,895
And then it's gone.

860
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
